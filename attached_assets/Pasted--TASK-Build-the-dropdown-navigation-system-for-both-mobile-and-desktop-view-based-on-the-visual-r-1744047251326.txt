✅ TASK: Build the dropdown navigation system for both mobile and desktop view, based on the visual references I will upload.

⚙️ Dropdown Behavior Overview:

Mobile:

When the dropdown opens, it should take up the entire screen height.

Navigation buttons are stacked at the top.

At the bottom, a horizontal carousel of portfolio images appears (swipeable).

Desktop:

The dropdown has a fixed base size of 1725x572px, optimized for screens like 1728x1117.

The layout must be responsive and adapt gracefully to smaller desktop/laptop screens without breaking the design.

The left side contains the navigation buttons.

The right side contains 3 portfolio images.

🎥 Video Background Behavior:

The background video should remain looping and visible even when the dropdown is open.

When the dropdown is open, apply a black transparent overlay (or subtle blur) over the video.

This overlay should not interrupt video playback.

🔁 Dynamic Image Logic:

When no subcategory is selected, show a default set of 3 portfolio images (I will upload them).

When a subcategory is selected (e.g. “Character Design” or “Mobile Games”), replace the default images with images from that subcategory (we’ll implement the dynamic logic later).

Default images should only be shown initially, before any category is selected.

🎨 Logo Behavior:

I will upload two logos: a white logo (used normally) and a black logo (used when the dropdown is open).

When the dropdown is open:

The black logo should be shown instead of the white one.

On desktop, keep the hover animation with orange highlight on both logos, whether the dropdown is open or not.

📱 Social Media Icons:

Social media icons (X, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) are already uploaded and should be used as-is.

When the dropdown is open:

Hide all footer elements, except for the social icons, which should remain visible and fixed at the bottom.

💡 Additional Notes:

Do not break existing responsive behavior on the homepage.

Only build the static layout and logic now; dynamic switching of image sets will be added in the next step.

Make sure code is clean, modular, and responsive.
